# Micromobility

A data visualization showing three types of micromobility - docked bikeshare, dockless bikeshare, and e-scooters - across the United States from 2015-2019.

Interact with each city to see how its micromobility footprint changed over time. Zoom all the way into a city to see the distribution of individual docked bikeshare stations.

Basemap built in Mapbox Studio. Interactivity built with Mapbox GL JS. Data and full report on Bikeshare and E-Scooter Systems in the U.S. can be found [here](https://data.bts.gov/stories/s/fwcs-jprj).
